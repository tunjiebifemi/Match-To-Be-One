                                                    It is not a good idea to become too attached or possessive in the relationship, especially when you 
                                                    both have not gotten to a particular level of closeness, hence give it time and do not be in a rush

                                                    this is to check them on social media and see what they put out in order to know who they really are.
                                                    A background check helps to know the person that you are just getting to know better, just in case
